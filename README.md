# OCL2PSQL
 
The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is a textual, declarative language 
typically used as part of the UML standard
for specifying constraints and queries 
on models.

OCL2PSQL implements a novel mapping
from OCL to pure SQL that deals with 
(possibly nested) iterator expressions, 
without resorting to imperative features of SQL. 

OCL2PSQL generates SQL queries that can be efficiently 
executed on mid- and large-size SQL databases.
