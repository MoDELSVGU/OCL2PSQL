1. unique names for properties: right now, assuming attribute
have different names for different classes
2. parsing: if an expression is wrongly type, unexpected result
may happen. For example, because "x" is really nothing
else than "item", 
"Reg_User::allInstances()->collect(u:Reg_User|u = u1)"
returns a valid sql query (when it should not).
3. Also, for association-ends: right now, we use lexicographic
order to "fix" the name of the "product"-tables.

4. Semantics of ->size() when is the result of a collect (bag?)
5. Select / Collect: several nested iterators ---> WHERE?
